# Make a SASSy CSS Cocktail: Bourbon and Bitters Served Neat

## Presentation Abstract

With the popularity of CSS frameworks and preprocessors, there are many options available for web developers in modularizing their styles. But once we’ve gotten past some of the “do-it-all” frameworks like Twitter’s Bootstrap, how can we maintain more control but still ease our development?

Simple! Three small SASS libraries: Bourbon, Neat, and Bitters. Using these three libraries, we can easily build and maintain a site’s user interface, including taking advantage of newer CSS3 features such as transitions, transforms, and responsive design. In this session, we’ll setup a SASS environment and get to work building a UI that you can easily maintain even after a few drinks.
